<h1> A Soft Cover Book Report</h1>
<h2> Moby-Dick (or, The Whale)</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.softcover.io/" target="_blank">Softcover</a> publishing platform was designed mainly for ebooks line some popular IT textbooks but it's also good for making more traditional books, such as the novel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman Melville (sometimes written as <em>Moby Dick</em>). We present below a short and effectionately irreverent book report on this classic of American literature.</p>

<h3>Moby-Dick: A classic tale of the sea</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.softcover.io/read/6070fb03/moby-dick"><img src="images/moby_dick.png" target="_blank"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.softcover.io/read/6070fb03/moby-dick"><em>Moby-Dick</em></a> by Herman Melville begins with these immortal words:</p>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin: right 10%;">Call me Ishmael. Some years ago-never mind how long precisely-having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.</p>
<p>After driving off his spleen (which<em> can't</em> be good for you), Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein for approximately one jillion pages. The only thing bigger than Moby Dick (who &mdash;<em>spoiler alert!</em>&mdash;is a giant white whale) is the book itself.</p>
